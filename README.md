Emotion Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Project Overview
Emotion Detection is a project aimed at identifying human emotions from facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project leverages OpenCV for real-time video processing and GUI display.

Repository Contents
custom_cnn_model.keras: Pre-trained Keras model for emotion detection.
DEMO.py: Python script that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using OpenCV to demonstrate the emotion detection model.
Emotion_Detection_Complete_Project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for training and evaluating the emotion detection model.
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: XML file for Haar cascade classifier used for face detection.
requirements.txt: List of Python libraries required to run DEMO.py and test.py.
test.py: Python script with a GUI similar to DEMO.py for testing the model.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pip
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/emotion-detection-cnn.git
cd emotion-detection-cnn
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Demo
To run the GUI demo of the emotion detection model:

bash
Copy code
python DEMO.py
Running the Test Script
To run the test script with the GUI:

bash
Copy code
python test.py
Usage
The DEMO.py and test.py scripts open a window displaying the video feed from your webcam. The model will detect faces and display the predicted emotions in real-time.
The Emotion_Detection_Complete_Project.ipynb notebook can be used to understand and reproduce the training process of the model.
Model Details
The custom CNN model used for emotion detection is saved in the custom_cnn_model.keras file. This model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions and is capable of predicting multiple emotions.

Face Detection
The project uses the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection. The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file is a pre-trained model provided by OpenCV for this purpose.
